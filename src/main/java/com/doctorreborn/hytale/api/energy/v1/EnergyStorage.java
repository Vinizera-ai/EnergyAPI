 * <li>{@link #supportsInsertion} and {@link #supportsExtraction} can be used to
 * tell if insertion and extraction

 * <li>{@link #insert} and {@link #extract} can be used to insert or extract

 * <li>{@link #iterator} can be used to inspect the contents of this

 * Users that wish to implement this interface can use the helpers in the
 * {@code base} package:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link CombinedEnergyStorage} can be used to combine multiple instances,

 * example to combine multiple "slots" in one big storage.</li>
 * <li>{@link ExtractionOnlyEnergyStorage} and

 * {@link com.shailist.hytale.api.transfer.v1.storage.StoragePreconditions} can
 * be used for these checks.
 *
 * <p>
 * For transfer functions, the returned amount must be non-negative, and smaller
